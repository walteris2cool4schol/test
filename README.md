*Hi! I'm just a chronically online weirdo like most people. If you're here, chances are you saw me on Pony Town. Here's some stuff about me, plus my boundaries.*
* :. I have ASD and GAD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) and (General Anxiety Disorder.) Bear with me as I suck in social situations, but I'm trying to start socializing more!
* Whenever you see me, *ALWAYS* feel free to C+H! Even if I have *DNI* in my name. :) .:
* :. I'm in high school. Won't say exactly what year or my age, but I fall within that gap. Take that as you will if you'd like to interact. 
* I support therians, furries, systems, venting, selfshippers, roleplayers, etc! As long as you're doing nothing **GENUINELY WRONG**?? Then what's the point of cringe culture? "Cringe" culture is dead XP .:
* Currently hyperfixated on Big Mama Eternal's content. You're usually gonna find me as Eternal. Go figure, as that's what I currently go by online...
* :. I *LOVELOVELOVE* music and fandoms! I know a good bit of them even if I have very few I'm hyperfixated on, and I'd love to hear you yap about your interests lmao
* If you don't have an online family. I'm legally adopting you. Too bad, you don't have a choice in the matter! /hj
* Be my friend. PLEASE. You're so cool, random stranger on the internet!
# ✰ Bye! Eternal out!
